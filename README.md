# About me

Here are a few things about me - I have approximately twenty years of law enforcement, investigations, and cyber threat intelligence experience - specifically with regards to fraud and cybercrime investigations.  I began my career with the DC Police and then took an opportunity with the Florida Department of Financial Services.  Shortly thereafter, I pivoted my career and worked with several financial institutions in fraud, anti-money laundering and security.  After earning an undergraduate degree in Administration of Justice from the University of Pittsburgh, I earned a graduate degree in Criminal Justice from the University of Cincinnati and am currently enrolled at Carnegie Mellon University in the MSIT Cyber Security and Assurance program.  From there, I pivoted again and work with the National Cyber Forensics and Training Alliance in a cyber financial intelligence role.    

## What I hope to learn

What I hope to learn - I use data visualization every day.  Generally, I complete pivot charts and graphs based on spreadsheet data, and I'll complete link analysis on criminal organizations or events.  I know that I can greatly improve my usage of better tools and better concepts in order to provide better visualizations for reports and presentations.  Importantly, Iâ€™d like to learn more about visualization and develop a training module for my coworkers to improve their skills as well.
